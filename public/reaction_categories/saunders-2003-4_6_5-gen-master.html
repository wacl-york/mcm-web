<h1>The permutation reactions of RO<sub>2</sub>
</h1>
<p> The "permutation" reactions of a given RO<sub>2</sub>
radical are its self reaction (1), and its cross reactions (2) with other
peroxy radicals, R′O<sub>2</sub>, for which a number of product channels:</p>

<p>Available rate coefficients for the permutation reactions of RO<sub>2</sub> have been reviewed
by <a href="references#lightfoot_1992">Lightfoot et al. (1992)</a>,

<a href="references#lesclaux_1997">Lesclaux (1997)</a>, 
<a href="references#atkinson_1999">Atkinson et al. (1999)</a> 
and <a href="references#tyndall_2001">Tyndall et al. (2001)</a>, 
with recommendations made in a number of cases. In view of the large
number of RO<sub>2</sub> radicals generated in a detailed chemical mechanism,
however, it is unrealistic to represent these reactions explicitly, and the use
of a simplified parameterisation is essential 
(<a href="references#madronich_1990">Madronich and Calvert, 1990</a>). 
A very simplified approach is adopted in the MCM, in which each peroxy radical is
assumed to react with all other peroxy radicals (i.e. the peroxy radical
"pool") at a single, collective rate (<a href="references#jenkin_1997">Jenkin et al. 1997</a>). 
This is achieved by defining a parameter <b>ΣRO2</b> which is the sum of the concentrations of all peroxy radicals, 
excluding HO<sub>2</sub>. The collective rate of all the permutation reactions of a particular peroxy
radical is then represented by a pseudo-unimolecular reaction, which has an
assigned rate coefficient equal to <i>k</i><sub>3</sub>.<b>ΣRO2</b>:</p>

<p>Each reaction has up to three product channels, the
branching ratios of which depend on the structure of the radical, as shown in
Table 1. </p>

<p>The assigned values of <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> for various classes of peroxy radical (as given in
Table 2) also depend on the structure of the organic group, and are based on
trends of reactivity of peroxy radical self reactions. The parameters are twice
the geometric mean of an estimated self-reaction rate co-efficient, <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>, for that class of
peroxy radical and the self-reaction rate coefficient for CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
(i.e. it is assumed that CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is the major reaction
partner). Accordingly, the representation of the reaction for CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
itself reduces to its self-reaction with recommended rate coefficient and
branching ratios, when it is the dominant radical. The rate coefficients for
alkyl peroxy radicals are also taken to apply to remotely substituted (i.e. not
α or β) oxygen- and chlorine-containing radicals, radicals containing
unsaturated linkages, and β -nitro-oxy peroxy radicals.</p>
