<h1>Reactions of organic radicals</h1>
<br>
<p> The large majority of organic radicals (R) react rapidly and exclusively with oxygen under tropospheric
conditions, to form stabilised peroxy radicals, RO<sub>2</sub>:</p>
<p></p>

<div class="equation">
      R + O<sub>2</sub>  (+M) → RO<sub>2</sub>   (1)
    </div>
<p> This is assumed in almost all cases in the MCM. In a small number of exceptions, 
decomposition of either the organic radical itself, or the intermediate peroxy
radical is believed to occur, leading to the overall chemistry shown, under tropospheric 
conditions:</p>

<p> In a number of other cases, the organic radical can isomerise prior to addition of O<sub>2</sub>. 
For example, the terminal addition of OH or NO<sub>3</sub> to the conjugated dienes
considered in the MCM (1,3-butadiene and isoprene)
leads to the production of hydroxy or nitro-oxy
substituted organic radicals containing an allyl resonance. Consequently, 
the addition of O<sub>2</sub> in these cases can lead
to the production of two isomeric RO<sub>2</sub> radicals. In the hydroxy
substituted cases, the peroxy radical is assumed to
be produced at the more substituted site with 75% probability, since this
assumption has been shown to lead to a reasonable description of the observed
products of the OH initiated degradation of isoprene (<a href="references#jenkin_1995">Jenkin and Hayman, 1995</a>). 
In the nitro-oxy substituted cases, 
the formation of the peroxy radical exclusively at the
other terminal carbon (i.e. 1,4 addition) is assumed
for isoprene, whereas 1,4 addition and 1,2-addition are assumed to compete
equally for 1,3-butadiene. These assumptions are based on the data of 
<a href="references#skov_1992">Skov et al. (1992)</a>.</p>
<p> In the cases of α- and β-pinene,
the hydroxyl-substituted tertiary organic radicals generated from OH addition are
assumed to isomerise partially prior to O<sub>2</sub> addition under tropospheric conditions, 
following the mechanism suggested by 
<a href="references#noziere_1999">Noziere et al. (1999)</a> and 
<a href="references#vereecken_2000">Vereecken and Peeters (2000)</a>. 
The importance of the isomerisation mechanism is set such that the primary yield
of the isomerised radical from the reaction of the terpene
with OH is 7.5%. The subsequent chemistry leads to formation of acetone as a
first generation product in each case with a yield of ca. 6.5%, which is
consistent with the reported range (<a href="references#aschmann_1998">Aschmann et al.,
1998</a>; <a href="references#noziere_1999">Noziere et al., 1999</a>;
