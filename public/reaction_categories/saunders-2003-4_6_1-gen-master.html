<h1>The Reactions of RO<sub>2</sub> with NO</h1>
<br>
<p>
      Available rate coefficients for the reactions of RO<sub>2</sub>
      with NO have been reviewed by 
      <a href="references#lightfoot_1992">Lightfoot et al. (1992)</a>,
      Wallington et al. (<a href="references#wallington_1992">1992</a>;
      <a href="references#wallington_1997">1997</a>),
      <a href="references#atkinson_1999">Atkinson et al. (1999)</a> and
      <a href="references#tyndall_2001">Tyndall et al. (2001)</a>,
      with recommendations made in a number of cases.  Where
      applicable, the kinetic data applied to these reactions in the
      MCM are consistent with these recommendations.  For the vast
      majority of the <i>ca.</i> 900 RO<sub>2</sub> radicals, however, kinetic
      data are unavailable, and the assigned rate coefficients are
      based on two generic expressions.  For acyl peroxy radicals a
      value of
    </p>
<div class="equation">
       <div class="equation_number">(i)</div>
      <i>k</i><sub>11</sub> = 8.1 × 10<sup>-12</sup> exp(270/<i>T</i>).ƒ
    </div>
<p>
      is used, based on the temperature-dependent rate coefficient reported for
      CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)O<sub>2</sub> by
      <a href="references#villalta_1996">Villalta and Howard (1996)</a>.
      For other classes of peroxy radical, rate coefficients are 
      defined by the experssion
    </p>
<div class="equation">
      <div class="equation_number">(ii)</div>
      <i>k</i><sub>11</sub> = 2.54 × 10<sup>-12</sup> exp(360/<i>T</i>).ƒ
    </div>
<p>
      which is the product of the rate coefficient and an efficiency
      factor, ƒ.  The rate coefficient is based on
      recommended values for CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and
      C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>

      (<a href="references#atkinson_1999">Atkinson et al., 1999</a>), and the
      observations of
      <a href="references#eberhard_1997">Eberhard et al. (1997)</a> and
      Eberhard and Howard (<a href="references#eberhard_1996">1996</a>;
      <a href="references#eberhard_1997a">1997</a>)

      for C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> alkyl peroxy radicals.  A unity
      value of ƒ is thus applied to alkyl peroxy radicals in
      general.  In contrast to the treatment of alkyl peroxy radicals in our previous protocol
      (<a href="references#jenkin_1997">Jenkin et al., 1997</a>), therefore,
      there is no dependence of the rate coefficient on peroxy radical size.

      A unity value of ƒ is also applied to the majority of
      other peroxy radicals with the exception of α-chlorinated
      peroxy radicals and β-chlorinated peroxy radicals, for
      which respective values of 2.2 and 1.6 are used, to account for
      the consistently larger reported rate coefficients for a number
      of C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> halogenated RO<sub>2</sub>,
      as described previously (<a href="references#jenkin_1997">Jenkin et al., 1997</a>).
    </p>
<p>
      The following two channels are considered for the reactions of RO<sub>2</sub>
      with NO:
    </p>
<table class="reactions"><tbody>
<tr>
<td>RO<sub>2</sub> + NO</td>
	  <td>→</td>
	  <td>RO + NO<sub>2</sub>
</td>
	  <td>(11a)</td>
	</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
	  <td>→</td>
	  <td>RONO<sub>2</sub>
</td>
	  <td>(11b)</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
      The assigned branching ratios for the nitrate-forming channels,
      <i>k</i><sub>11b</sub>/(<i>k</i><sub>11a</sub> + <i>k</i><sub>11b</sub>),
      are based on experimental measurements, where possible
      (<a href="references#carter_1989">Carter and Atkinson 1989</a>;
      <a href="references#lightfoot_1992">Lightfoot et al., 1992</a>).
    </p>
<p>
      Where data are not available, ratios for other primary,
      secondary and tertiary alkyl peroxy radicals are calculated
      using the expression recommended originally by
      <a href="references#carter_1989">Carter and Atkinson (1989)</a>
      and subsequently by Atkinson
      (<a href="references#atkinson_1990">1990</a>,
      <a href="references#atkinson_1994">1994</a>).
      On the basis of available data for peroxy radicals formed from propene,
      methyl propene and cis-2-butene
      (<a href="references#shepson_1985">Shepson et al., 1985</a>;
      <a href="references#lightfoot_1992">Lightfoot et al., 1992</a>;
      <a href="references#muthuramu_1993">Muthuramu et al., 1993</a>),
      ratios for β-hydroxy RO<sub>2</sub>, for which experimental data
      are not available, are taken to be 0.5 of the values for the
      corresponding unsubstituted alkyl RO<sub>2</sub>.
    </p>
<p>
      With the exception of δ-hydroxy RO<sub>2</sub> radicals,
      branching ratios for other RO<sub>2</sub> possessing functional
      groups remote from the peroxy radical centre are also calculated
      using the expression of
      <a href="references#carter_1989">Carter and Atkinson (1989)</a>
      for alkyl peroxy radicals of the same carbon number.  Ratios
      for δ-hydroxy RO<sub>2</sub> (i.e. formed following
      1,5 isomerisation reactions of oxy radicals as described below)
      have long been suspected to be somewhat lower than for the 
      unsubstituted counterparts
      (<a href="references#carter_1985">Carter and Atkinson (1985)</a>;
      <a href="references#carter_1995">Carter 1995</a>),
      and nitrate formation has often been assumed not to occur in these cases.
      However, δ-hydroxy alkyl nitrates have recently been detected
      as products of the oxidation of hexane
      (<a href="references#eberhard_1995">Eberhard et al. (1995)</a>).
      The tentative yields in that study, and the recently observed chain
      formation of NO<sub>2</sub> during the oxidation of a series of
      C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>8</sub> alkanes
      (<a href="references#hoffman_1995">Hoffmann et al., 1995</a>)
      may be interpreted in terms of the formation of the organic nitrate
      being <i>ca.</i> 40% as efficient for δ-hydroxy RO<sub>2</sub> compared
      with the corresponding alkyl peroxy radicals (i.e. the same carbon skeleton),
      and this is assumed in the present work.
    </p>
<p>
      For acyl and α-carbonyl RO<sub>2</sub> radicals, the ratio is taken as zero, on
      the basis of observations for CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)O<sub>2</sub>
      and CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
      (<a href="references#lightfoot_1992">Lightfoot et al., 1992</a>).
      For simplicity, and in the absence of definitive product data, the ratios
      for the β-nitro-oxy peroxy radicals are assumed to be zero.
    </p>
<p>
      On the basis of data presented by <a href="references#lightfoot_1992">Lightfoot et al., 1992</a>,
      values of <i>k</i><sub>11b</sub>/(<i>k</i><sub>11a</sub> + <i>k</i><sub>11b</sub>),

      for the C<sub>5</sub> alkyl type peroxy radicals derived from
      the OH-initiated oxidation of isoprene are all taken to be 0.10.
      Ratios for the similar C<sub>4</sub> peroxy radicals formed from 1,3-butadiene are
      assumed to be 0.065, on the basis of the relative ratios calculated for
      C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>5</sub> alkyl peroxy radicals
      (<a href="references#carter_1989">Carter and Atkinson (1989)</a>).
