The original Common Representative Intermediates (CRI) mechanism, version 2 (CRI v2), is a reduced mechanism describing ozone formation from the tropospheric degradation of methane and 115 emitted non-methane hydrocarbons and oxygenated volatile organic compounds. It was developed using the Master Chemical Mechanism version 3.1 (MCM v3.1) as a reference benchmark (see the <a href="about/construction">Construction Methodology</a> page for more details).
</p>

<p>
The mechanism available at the current site is denoted CRI v2.2. This includes substantially revised chemistry for isoprene degradation, but otherwise possesses the same reaction set as CRI v2.1. It also includes some common rate coefficient revisions consistent with those in the MCM v3.2 to v3.3.1 transition (see the <a href="about/construction">Construction Methodology</a> page for more details).

<p>
CRI v2.1. is available in download form only. This possesses the same reaction set as CRI v2, but has undergone some common rate coefficient revisions in parallel with those in the MCM v3.1 to v3.2 transition. A series of five reduced variants of CRI v2 (denoted R1 - R5) which have been developed, through systematic lumping of the emitted anthropogenic VOC species set, are also available to download (see the <a href="about/construction">Construction Methodology</a> page for more details).
