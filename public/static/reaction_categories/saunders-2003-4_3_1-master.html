<h1>NO<sub>3</sub> initiation reactions</h1>
<br>
<p>
NO<sub>3</sub> initiated degradation chemistry is included for those VOC for which both the following
relations apply:</p>
<p></p>

<div class="equation">
      <i>k</i><sub>(NO<sub>3</sub> + VOC)</sub> &gt; 10<sup>-5</sup><i>k</i><sub>(OH + VOC)</sub>
</div>
<p></p>

<div class="equation">
      <i>k</i><sub>(NO<sub>3</sub> + VOC)</sub> &gt; 10<sup>-16</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>
</div>
<p>These relations were formulated on the basis that typical boundary layer concentrations of OH and NO<sub>3</sub>
are 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>9</sup> molecule cm<sup>-3</sup>, respectively.
Thus, the first criterion applies when the removal rate by reaction with NO<sub>3</sub>
exceeds 1% of the removal rate by reaction with OH, and the second when the
lifetime of the VOC with respect to reaction with NO<sub>3</sub> is less than
107 s (<i>ie</i>. <i>ca</i>. 100 days). NO<sub>3</sub> initiated degradation
is therefore believed to be important for alkenes, dienes, aldehydes and ethers.</p>
<h2>Rates of initial reactions</h2>
<p>Rate coefficients for the reactions of NO<sub>3</sub> with organic compounds have been reviewed by
Atkinson (<a href="references#atkinson_1991">1991</a>; 
<a href="references#atkinson_1994">1994</a>; 
<a href="references#atkinson_1997">1997a</a>), 
<a href="references#wayne_1991">Wayne et al. (1991)</a>,
<a href="references#atkinson_1999">Atkinson et al. (1999)</a> and 
<a href="references#calvert_2000">Calvert et al. (2000)</a>. 
The reviews of Atkinson and Calvert also make recommendations in
many cases. These recommendations are used unless superseded by more recent
evaluations. If recent laboratory determinations are available, which are
likely to influence, or form the basis of future recommendations, these are
also taken into account. The reactions of NO<sub>3</sub> with aldehydes for which no experimental data exist, are
assigned an appropriate generic rate coefficient based on the data presented in
Table 1, which makes use of a substantial new body of kinetic data on this
class of reaction 
(<a href="references#papagni_2000">Papagni et al., 2000</a>; 
<a href="references#ullerstam_2000">Ullerstam et al., 2000</a>; 
<a href="references#danna_2001">DAnna et al., 2001</a>). 
The generic coefficients allow for the observed significant
increase in the rate coefficient with increasing carbon number and branching
for the series of aldehydes considered in these studies.</p>

<p>The kinetics of the reactionsof NO<sub>3</sub> with dimethylether, diethyl ether, di-<i>n</i>-propyl ether
and methyl <i>t</i>-butyl ether have been studied by 
<a href="references#langer_1994">Langer and Ljungström (1994)</a>, 
and the reported rate coefficients are used accordingly. Partial rate
coefficients for methyl, ethyl, <i>n</i>-propyl and <i>t</i>-butylgroups of 0.13, 1.40, 3.25 and 0.51 (
in units of 10<sup>-15</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>
molecule s<sup>-1</sup>) may be inferred from these data, and were used for
these groups and related hydroxy substituted groups in the ethers and glycol ethers considered in the present work. 
In the absence of experimental data, the partial rate coefficient for the n-butyl group is
assumed equivalent to that for the <i>n</i>-propyl group.</p>
<p>Rate coefficients for the reactions of NO<sub>3</sub> with monoalkenes increase dramatically with alkyl substitution 
(Atkinson, 
<a href="references#atkinson_1991">1991</a>, 
<a href="references#atkinson_1994">1994</a>; 
<a href="references#wayne_1991">Wayne et al. 1991</a>). 
Table 2 lists a series of generic rate coefficients, which were estimated by analogy. These are
used in the absence of available experimental data.</p>

<h2>Initial radical products</h2>
<p>The reactions of NO<sub>3</sub> with aldehydes are assumed to proceed via abstraction
of the aldehydic H-atom, leading to the production of acyl radicals. The reactions with ethers and glycol ethers
are also assumed to result in H-atom abstraction.</p>
<p>The attack of NO<sub>3</sub> on alkenes, dienes and monoterpenes is assumed to proceed by an addition mechanism, 
leading to the formation of β-nitro-oxy-substituted alkyl radicals.  In the present
work, the addition of NO<sub>3</sub> to alkenes of generic formulae CH<sub>2</sub>=CHR,
CH<sub>2</sub>=CRR<sup>1</sup> and CHR=CR<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup> is assumed
to occur on the less alkyl substituted carbon 65, 80 and 65% of the time,
respectively. Thus, in the case of CH<sub>2</sub>=CHR:</p>
<table class="reactions"><tbody>
<tr>
<td>NO<sub>3</sub> + CH<sub>2</sub>=CHR</td>
	  <td>→</td>
	  <td>CH<sub>2</sub>(ONO<sub>2</sub>)CHR (65%)</td>
	  <td>(3a)</td>
	</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
	  <td>→</td>
	  <td>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(ONO<sub>2</sub>)R (35%)</td>
	  <td>(3b)</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>For unsymmetric alkenes of generic formula CHR=CHR<sup>1</sup> or CRR<sup>1</sup>=CR<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3</sup>,
NO<sub>3</sub> is assumed to add equally at both sites. On the basis of the data of 
<a href="references#skov_1992">Skov et al. (1992)</a>, the addition of NO<sub>3</sub>, 
to 1,3-butadiene is assumed to occur only at the terminal carbon atoms, and in the case of isoprene,
entirely at the terminal carbon adjacent to the methyl substitution.
