<h1>O<sub>3</sub> initiation reactions</h1>
<br>
<p>O<sub>3</sub> initiated
degradation chemistry is included for those VOC for which both the following
relations apply:</p>
<div class="equation">
      <i>k</i><sub>(O<sub>3</sub> + VOC)</sub> &gt; 10<sup>-8</sup><i>k</i><sub>(OH + VOC)</sub>
</div>
<br>
<div class="equation">
      <i>k</i><sub>(O<sub>3</sub> + VOC)</sub> &gt; 10<sup>-19</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>
</div>
<p>
These relations were
formulated on the basis that typical ambient concentrations of OH and O<sub>3</sub>
in the boundary layer are 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>12</sup> molecule cm<sup>-3</sup>,
respectively. Thus, the first criterion applies when the removal rate by
reaction with O<sub>3</sub> exceeds 1 % of the removal rate by reaction with
OH, and the second when the lifetime of the VOC with respect to reaction with O<sub>3</sub>
is less than 107 s (<i>ca.</i> 100 days). O<sub>3</sub>
initiated degradation is expected to be important only for alkenes, dienes, monoterpenes and some
unsaturated oxygenated products.</p>
<h2>Rates of initial reactions</h2>
<p>Rate coefficients for the reactions of O<sub>3</sub> with alkenes, dienes and monoterpenes have been reviewed by 
Atkinson (<a href="references#atkinson_1994">1994</a>; <a href="references#atkinson_1997">1997a</a>),
<a href="references#atkinson_1999">Atkinson et al. (1999)</a> and <a href="references#calvert_2000">Calvert et al., 2000</a>
with recommendations made in many cases. These recommendations are used unless superseded
by more recent evaluations. If recent laboratory determinations are available,
which are likely to influence, or form the basis of future recommendations, these
are also taken into account. Where no experimental data exist for monoalkenes, an appropriate generic rate coefficient
defined by analogy is used, as indicated in Table 1.</p>

<h2>Initial products</h2>
<p> The reaction mechanisms follow the general pattern described by 
<a href="references#atkinson_1997">Atkinson (1997a)</a> and 
<a href="references#calvert_2000">Calvert et al. (2000)</a>, 
with addition of ozone to the double bond leading initially to the formation
of an energy rich primary ozonide. This ozonide decomposes rapidly by the two possible channels,
each forming a carbonyl compound and a Criegee biradical, which also possesses excess energy (denoted ‡):

<p>
Available data on primary carbonyl product yields
indicate that both channels typically make an important contribution to the
reaction (e.g. <a href="references#calvert_2000">Calvert et al., 2000</a>), 
although formation of the more alkyl substituted Criegee biradical tends to be favoured. As described previously 
(<a href="references#jenkin_1997">Jenkin et al., 1997</a>), the two channels are currently 
assumed to compete equally in the majority of cases in the MCM. For α- and β-pinene,
however, the route forming the more substituted Criegee biradical is assigned a higher probability of 60%.
Note that in the case of α-pinene (and other endocyclic alkenes) the product of either reaction (1a) or
(1b) is a Criegee biradical of the same carbon number as the parent VOC, which also contains a carbonyl substitution
(i.e. separate carbonyl and biradical products are not formed).</p>
<p>
In the case of the unsymmetric diene, isoprene 
(the only such compound currently considered in the MCM), addition of ozone to the less substituted double bond
is assumed to be favoured relative to the more substituted double bond by a factor of 1.5, which is in accordance with 
the results of 
<a href="references#grosjean_1993">Grosjean et al. (1993)</a> and 
<a href="references#aschmann_1994">Aschmann and Atkinson (1994)</a></p>
