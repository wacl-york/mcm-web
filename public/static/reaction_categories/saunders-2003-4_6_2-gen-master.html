<h1>The Reactions of RO<sub>2</sub> with NO<sub>2</sub>
</h1>
<br>
<p>These reactions are only treated in the MCM for <b><i>acyl</i></b> peroxy radicals, for which the
product peroxy nitrates (ROONO<sub>2</sub>) are comparatively stable, and for
the most abundant peroxy radical, CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>:</p>
<p> </p>

<div class="equation">
      RO<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> (+M) â†” ROONO<sub>2</sub> (+M) (1, -1)  
    </div>
<p> Available rate coefficients for the forward and reverse reactions have been reviewed by 
<a href="references#lightfoot_1992">Lightfoot et al. (1992)</a>, 
Wallington et al. (<a href="http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM/references.htt#wallington_1992">1992</a>; 
<a href="references#wallington_1997">1997</a>), 
<a href="references#atkinson_1999">Atkinson et al. (1999)</a> and 
<a href="references#tyndall_2001">Tyndall et al. (2001)</a>. 
In the absence of rate data for the  acyl peroxy radical forward reaction (1), and the reverse peroxy nitrate decomposition 
reaction (-1) the rates are assumed equivalent to that for CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)O<sub>2</sub> and 
CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)OONO<sub>2</sub> respectively.</p>
